摘要

Effective collaboration is essential for engineers at geographically dispersed locations to accomplish good design with less iteration.

分散在世界各地的工程師若希望以較少的重複流程來完成好的設計, 需要仰賴有效率的協同.

Over the last several years, more and more efforts have been put into such research as many  industries have distributed their product development to locations with knowledge force. 

過去幾年, 有越來越多的業者將心力投注在利用各地的知識人力來進行分散式產品開發.

This paper presents a collaborative engine to facilitate collaborations among distributed  mechanical designs. 

本論文提出一種協同引擎(設計), 可用來協助分散式機械設計有效進行協同.

Using component-based software technology, collaboration functionality is developed into a set of groupware that makes the collaborative engine applicable to develop new collaborative applications  or integrate legacy applications into collaborative environments.

(本研究)運用元件導向的軟體技術, 將協同功能置入組群組軟體中, 讓此一協同系統可以用來開發新的協同應用或將傳統應用程式與協同環境加以整合.

An XML-based information representation is developed to streamline the information transmission    within the distributed environment.

(本研究)採用以 XML 為基礎的資訊表示法, 以便讓分散式環境中的資訊傳遞得以流暢進行.

A case study is carried out to show how this engine facilitates designers to collaboratively create  a 3D solid model of a same part in real time.

(本研究)利用案例研究來說明此一(協同)引擎如何有效協助設計者以即時協同模式建立 3D 實體模型.
